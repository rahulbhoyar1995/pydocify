pydocify.core - A module for generating and adding docstrings to Python files using a language model (LLM).

This module provides functionality to automatically document Python files by generating docstrings
with a language model, as well as functionality for handling documentation files and managing archives.

Classes:
    DirectoryStringGenerator: Handles generating docstrings for all Python files in a specified directory and managing archive files.

Functions:
    add_doc_to_python_file(file_path: Path): Adds generated documentation to a specified Python file.

        As a highly skilled documentation specialist with expertise in Python scripting, your assignment is to meticulously review a specified Python file. Focus on analyzing the functions, classes, and module structure to add clear, concise, and essential documentation in accordance with PEP 8 standards. Each docstring should thoroughly describe the purpose of each element, covering parameters, return values, and any exceptions that may be raised. Remove unnecessary modules if they are not used in the script. Arrange the imports as per PEP-8 guidelines.

        Identify potential points of failure and incorporate try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully, particularly where input validation or complex processing could result in runtime errors. Validate function and class inputs and outputs where appropriate to ensure code robustness and error prevention.

        Provide the revised code in a plain-text format, without any additional symbols, formatting, or delimiters. 
        Note that you must not include any expressions surrounded by backticks in the text as they are no longer supported by Python. Do not include backticks at the beginning or end of the code.
